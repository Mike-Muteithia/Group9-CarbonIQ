# CarbonIQ — AI-Powered Carbon Emission Tracker

**Group 9 MVP Project** - Empowering individuals and organizations to understand, analyze, and reduce their carbon footprint through data and AI-driven insights.

## 🌍 Project Overview

CarbonIQ is a full-stack AI-powered web application that enables users to track, analyze, and reduce carbon emissions generated by vehicles, aircraft, and machines.

The platform not only calculates emissions but also leverages AI behavioral nudges to motivate users toward sustainable, eco-friendly habits.

By making environmental data actionable and personalized, CarbonIQ aims to bridge the gap between awareness and meaningful climate action.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Many individuals and organizations lack visibility into how their transportation and machinery use impacts the environment. Even when emission data exists, it often feels abstract and disconnected from actionable steps.

CarbonIQ solves this by:
- Providing clear emission tracking and visualization
- Using AI-generated nudges to inspire behavior change
- Encouraging measurable, incremental sustainability goals

## 👥 Target Users

- **Individuals** — track personal travel or machine usage to understand impact
- **Businesses & Organizations** — monitor emissions from fleets or equipment
- **Environmental Advocates** — analyze emission trends and promote data-driven sustainability

## 🚀 MVP Goals

- Validate user value in tracking and visualizing emission data
- Test effectiveness of AI-based nudges in influencing eco-friendly habits
- Measure engagement to refine AI and UX design
