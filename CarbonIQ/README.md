CarbonIQ ‚Äî AI-Powered Carbon Emission Tracker
Group 9 MVP ProjectEmpowering individuals and organizations to understand, analyze, and reduce their carbon footprint through data and AI-driven insights.

Project Overview
CarbonIQ is a full-stack AI-powered web application that enables users to track, analyze, and reduce carbon emissions generated by vehicles, aircraft, and machines.

The platform not only calculates emissions but also leverages AI behavioral nudges to motivate users toward sustainable, eco-friendly habits.

By making environmental data actionable and personalized, CarbonIQ aims to bridge the gap between awareness and meaningful climate action.

Problem Statement
Many individuals and organizations lack visibility into how their transportation and machinery use impacts the environment.

Even when emission data exists, it often feels abstract and disconnected from actionable steps.CarbonIQ solves this by:

Providing clear emission tracking and visualization

Using AI-generated nudges to inspire behavior change

Encouraging measurable, incremental sustainability goals

Target Users
Individuals ‚Äî track personal travel or machine usage to understand impact

Businesses & Organizations ‚Äî monitor emissions from fleets or equipment

Environmental Advocates ‚Äî analyze emission trends and promote data-driven sustainability

MVP Goals
Validate user value in tracking and visualizing emission data

Test effectiveness of AI-based nudges in influencing eco-friendly habits

Measure engagement to refine AI and UX design
