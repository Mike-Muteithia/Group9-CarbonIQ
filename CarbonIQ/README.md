CarbonIQ — AI-Powered Carbon Emission Tracker
================================================

> **Group 9 MVP Project**Empowering individuals and organizations to understand, analyze, and reduce their carbon footprint through data and AI-driven insights.

Project Overview
--------------------


**CarbonIQ** is a **full-stack AI-powered web application** that enables users to track, analyze, and reduce carbon emissions generated by vehicles, aircraft, and machines.

The platform not only calculates emissions but also leverages **AI behavioral nudges** to motivate users toward sustainable, eco-friendly habits.

By making environmental data **actionable and personalized**, CarbonIQ aims to bridge the gap between awareness and meaningful climate action.

 Problem Statement
--------------------

Many individuals and organizations lack visibility into how their transportation and machinery use impacts the environment.

Even when emission data exists, it often feels abstract and disconnected from actionable steps.**CarbonIQ** solves this by:

*   Providing clear emission tracking and visualization
    
*   Using **AI-generated nudges** to inspire behavior change
    
*   Encouraging measurable, incremental sustainability goals
    

 Target Users
---------------

*   **Individuals** — track personal travel or machine usage to understand impact
    
*   **Businesses & Organizations** — monitor emissions from fleets or equipment
    
*   **Environmental Advocates** — analyze emission trends and promote data-driven sustainability
    

MVP Goals
------------

*   Validate user value in tracking and visualizing emission data
    
*   Test effectiveness of AI-based nudges in influencing eco-friendly habits
    
*   Measure engagement to refine AI and UX design
    

🧩 Core Features
----------------

FeatureDescription**User Authentication**Secure sign-up, login, and profile management**Emission Tracking**Log vehicles, aircraft, and machinery usage**Carbon Calculation**Automatic CO₂ estimation via AI models and APIs**Dashboard & Insights**Visualize total emissions, top emitters, and summaries**AI Eco-Coach**Personalized recommendations and nudges for sustainable behavior**Goal Setting**Create and track emission-reduction goals**Pagination & Validation**Smooth navigation with input validation and paginated views

User Flow
------------

1.  User **signs up or logs in**.
    
2.  Adds an **asset** (vehicle, aircraft, machine).
    
3.  Logs an **activity** (trip, usage).
    
4.  System **calculates emissions**.
    
5.  **AI Eco-Coach** provides personalized recommendations.
    
6.  User **reviews dashboard insights** and sets sustainability goals.
    

AI Integration
-----------------
CarbonIQ integrates **OpenAI APIs** to analyze user activity patterns and generate:

*   Personalized eco-friendly recommendations
    
*   Motivational messages to reduce fuel or energy usage
    
*   Predictive insights based on user trends
