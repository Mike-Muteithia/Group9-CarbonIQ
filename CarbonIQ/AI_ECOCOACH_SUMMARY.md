## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Getting Started

**User**: "How can I reduce my carbon footprint?"

**AI**: "Great question! Based on your data, transportation is your biggest emission source at 45.2 kg CO₂ this month. I recommend trying public transportation or carpooling 2-3 days per week. This could reduce your transport emissions by 30-40%, saving about 13-18 kg CO₂ monthly. Would you like specific tips for your commute?"

### Example 2: Specific Category

**User**: "Tell me about energy savings"

**AI**: "Your energy consumption is 38.5 kg CO₂ this month. Here are three quick wins:

1. Switch to LED bulbs - saves 75% energy
2. Unplug devices when not in use - eliminates phantom power
3. Use a programmable thermostat - optimizes heating/cooling

These changes could reduce your energy emissions by 20-25%. Which would you like to try first?"

### Example 3: Progress Check

**User**: "How am I doing?"

**AI**: "You're doing great! Your emissions decreased by 12.3% this week compared to last week. That's 8.5 kg CO₂ saved - equivalent to planting 2 trees! 🌱

Your biggest improvement is in transportation (-18%). Keep up the excellent work! Want to tackle another category next?"
